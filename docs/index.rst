PyBaMM-TEA is the work of the "Google Summer of Code" project on a techno-economic analysis library for battery cells, which can be combined with PyBaMM's functionality. So far, there is a method to visualize mass- and volume- loadings of an electrode stack and to estimate energy densities without simulation. The project further aims to estimate cell metrics with simulations (e.g. a Ragone plot) and manufacturing metrics with a Process-based Cost Model.
